  Cuts a new release of the Poker Android app: bumps the version in app/build.gradle.kts,
  commits it to develop, fast-forward merges develop into main, builds a signed release AAB and
  APK, and copies the artifacts into releases/vX.Y/. Use this whenever the user asks to "build a
  release", "cut a release", "ship a release build", "bump the version and build", or similar for
  this project — including when they just say "let's release" or ask for a signed AAB/APK to
  upload to the Play Store.

# Build a release

This is the release process for the Poker app (an Android/Kotlin/Compose project). It takes the
repo from "develop has the changes we want to ship" to "main is updated and there's a signed AAB/APK
ready to upload," stopping right before anything gets pushed so the user can look things over.

Work through the steps below in order. Each one depends on the last succeeding, so don't skip ahead
if something fails — stop and surface the problem instead of guessing at a fix.

Every question to the user in this process — including the ones below — must be asked with the
AskUserQuestion tool (selectable options), never as a free-text prompt asking them to type a
response. Even open-ended-sounding questions (like the version name) should be offered as a small
set of concrete options, with a free-text "Other" always available as the fallback.

## 1. Confirm the starting state

- `git status` — the working tree must be clean. If there are uncommitted changes, stop and use
  AskUserQuestion to ask what to do with them (e.g. "commit them separately first" / "stash them" /
  "include them in the release commit") rather than including them in the release commit by default.
- Confirm the current branch is `develop` (`git branch --show-current`). If not, use
  AskUserQuestion to ask whether to switch to it — the release always starts from develop.
- Check that `main` can fast-forward to `develop`: `git merge-base --is-ancestor main develop`.
  If this fails, main has commits develop doesn't (or they've diverged), and a fast-forward merge
  isn't possible. Stop and tell the user — don't fall back to a merge commit or force anything;
  that's a decision for them.

## 2. Bump the version

Read `app/build.gradle.kts` and find `versionCode` and `versionName` in `defaultConfig`.

- **versionCode**: increment by 1 automatically (Play Store requires each upload to have a higher
  versionCode than the last, so there's no real judgment call here).
- **versionName**: use AskUserQuestion to ask what it should be. Compute a next-minor-bump
  suggestion (e.g. `1.0` → `1.1`) and list it first as the recommended option, since that's this
  project's pattern so far, alongside a next-major-bump option (e.g. `1.0` → `2.0`); the tool's
  built-in "Other" covers a patch bump or anything else they'd rather type in.

Edit the two lines in place. Don't touch anything else in the file.

## 3. Commit the version bump to develop

```
git add app/build.gradle.kts
git commit -m "Bump version to <versionName> (<versionCode>)"
```

Use the project's usual commit message tone (short, imperative, no fluff — check `git log` if
unsure). Do not add attribution lines beyond whatever the session's standard git commit footer is.

## 4. Fast-forward merge develop into main

```
git checkout main
git merge --ff-only develop
git checkout develop
```

Leave the user back on `develop` afterwards since that's the working branch. If the ff-only merge
fails here despite the step 1 check (e.g. something changed in between), stop and report it rather
than retrying with a different merge strategy.

## 5. Build the signed release artifacts

Confirm signing is configured before building — check that `local.properties` (at the repo root)
has `release.storeFile` set. If it's missing, `assembleRelease`/`bundleRelease` will silently
produce an *unsigned* artifact, which isn't what a release build means. Stop and ask the user to
set up signing (see the README's "Release signing" section) rather than shipping unsigned output.

Once signing is confirmed, from the repo root:

```
./gradlew.bat bundleRelease assembleRelease
```

This produces both the AAB (for Play Store upload) and the APK (for sideloading/testing), matching
the project's convention of building both. If the build fails, stop and report the Gradle error —
don't attempt version or signing changes to work around a build failure without checking with the
user first.

## 6. Copy artifacts into releases/

Create `releases/v<versionName>/` at the repo root if it doesn't exist, and copy:

- `app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`
- `app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

into it. This folder is for local tracking across versions, not for committing — make sure
`releases/` is in `.gitignore`; add it there (as its own commit, or folded into a later step,
your judgment) if it isn't already, since these are large binary build outputs that don't belong
in git history.

## 7. Stop and report — do not push

Summarize for the user:

- Old version → new version (versionCode and versionName)
- The commit made on develop
- That main was fast-forwarded to match
- Where the AAB and APK ended up

Then use AskUserQuestion to explicitly ask whether to push (yes/no options). If they say yes, push
both branches:

```
git push origin develop main
```

Never push without this explicit confirmation, even if the user seems to be in a hurry — a push
to `main` on this repo is the one step in this whole process that's genuinely hard to undo cleanly.

## 8. Offer to install the release build on the phone

After the push question is resolved (regardless of whether they pushed), use AskUserQuestion to ask
whether to install this release build on their physical phone (yes/no options). Unlike day-to-day
dev/debug testing on this project — which is emulator-only — a finished, signed release build is
exactly what the phone is for, so installing it there is fine.

Check `adb devices` for a connected physical device (not an emulator, which shows as
`emulator-####`). If one is connected:

```
adb install -r releases/v<versionName>/app-release.apk
```

If no physical device is connected, say so and skip this step rather than falling back to the
emulator — the point of this step is to get the release onto the actual phone, not to run it
somewhere else.
